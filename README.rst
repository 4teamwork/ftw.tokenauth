ftw.tokenauth
=============

PAS plugin that facilitates **machine-to-machine authentication** by
implementing a two legged OAuth2 flow using service keys and short-lived
access tokens.

Installation
============

- Add ``ftw.tokenauth`` to your buildout configuration or as a dependency
  of your policy package:

  .. code:: ini
  
      [instance]
      eggs +=
          ftw.tokenauth

- Install the generic setup profile of ``ftw.tokenauth``.


Configuration
=============

For a user to be allowed to issue (or otherwise manage) service keys, they
require the ``ftw.tokenauth: Manage own Service Keys`` permission. So
integration packages need to assign this permission to roles that should be
allowed to use service keys.


Authentication flow
===================

The authentication flow involves four steps:

1. A logged in service user issues a service key in Plone, and stores the
   private key in a safe location accessible to the client application.

2. The client application uses the private key to create and sign a JWT
   authorization grant.

3. The client application exchanges the JWT authorization grant for a
   short-lived access token at the ``@@oauth2-token`` endpoint.

4. The client then uses this access token to authenticate requests to
   protected resources.


Assuming the client is in possession of a service key, the flow looks like this:

  .. code::

    +--------+                                     +---------------+
    |        |-- Create and sign JWT               |               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    |        |-- Use JWT to request token -------->|               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    | Client |                                     |     Plone     |
    |        |<----------------- Token response ---|               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    |        |-- Use token to authenticate ------->|               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    |        |                                     |               |
    +--------+                                     +---------------+

Usage
=====

In order to set up machine-to-machine authentication for a client, the
following steps need to be performed:

1. Issue Service Key
--------------------

A user that has already authenticated to Plone using regular means, and has
the ``ftw.tokenauth: Manage own Service Keys`` permission, can issue service
keys for their account via the ``@@manage-service-keys`` view
(``Manage Service Keys`` action in personal tools menu).

They need to issue a service key that is then displayed **exactly once** for
download, and store the private key in a safe location accessible to the
client that will use it.

2. Create and sign JWT authorization grant using service key
------------------------------------------------------------

In order to request an access token, the client application then uses the
private service key to create and sign a JWT.

The JWT needs to contain the following claims:

==== ========================================================================
Name Description
==== ========================================================================
iss  Issuer - must be ``client_id`` from service key
aud  Audience - must be ``token_uri`` from service key
sub  Subject - must be ``user_id`` from service key
iat  The time the assertion was issued, specified as seconds since
     00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970.
exp  The expiration time of the assertion, specified as seconds since
     00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970. This value has a maximum of 1 hour after
     the issued time.
==== ========================================================================

The JWT then needs to be signed with the private key. The only supported
signature algorithm is ``RS256``.


Python Example:

  .. code:: python

    import json
    import jwt
    import time

    # Load saved key from filesystem
    service_key = json.load(open('my_saved_key.json', 'rb'))

    private_key = service_key['private_key'].encode('utf-8')

    claim_set = {
        "iss": service_key['client_id'],
        "sub": service_key['user_id'],
        "aud": service_key['token_uri'],
        "iat": int(time.time()),
        "exp": int(time.time() + (60 * 60)),
    }
    grant = jwt.encode(claim_set, private_key, algorithm='RS256')


3. Token request (exchange JWT grant for an access token)
---------------------------------------------------------

The client then makes a token request to the ``token_uri`` with the JWT grant
it created.

This request needs to be a ``POST`` request with
``Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` and a request body that
contains the form encoded parameters.

Two parameters are required:

=========== =================================================================
Name        Description
=========== =================================================================
grant_type  Must always be ``urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer``
assertion   The JWT authorization grant
=========== =================================================================

The token endpoint will then respond with a token response containing the
access token:

  .. code:: python

    {"access_token": <token>,
     "expires_in": 3600,
     "token_type": "Bearer"}

The response will be of ``Content-Type: application/json`` and contain a JSON
encoded body.

Python Example:

  .. code:: python

    import requests

    GRANT_TYPE = 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer'

    payload = {'grant_type': GRANT_TYPE, 'assertion': grant}
    response = requests.post(service_key['token_uri'], data=payload)
    token = response.json()['access_token']

TODO: Document error responses for token requests


4. Use access token to authenticate requests
--------------------------------------------

The client can then use the access token to authenticate requests. The token
needs to be sent in the HTTP ``Authorization`` header as a ``Bearer`` token.

Once the token expires, the client must create a JWT authorization grant again,
and request a new access token.

Python Example:

  .. code:: python

    with requests.Session() as session:
        session.headers.update({'Authorization': 'Bearer %s' % token})
        response = session.get('http://localhost:8080/Plone/')
        # ...
